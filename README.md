# Overview

This plugin enables extra display options for y-axes.

## Series Boxes

The plugin can show a small colored box for each series on that axis. To enable, set `showRects: true` in the options
passed to the axis.

## Axis Header Text

The plugin can show configurable text for an axis. The most common usage of this might be to show the units
associated with the values on that axis. To enable, set `headerText: 'txt'` in the options passed to the axis.
